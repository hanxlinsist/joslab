## 工具的安装和启动 Qemu 和 JOS

参照 [Tools Used in 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2017/tools.html) 安装一系列的工具。下图是我成功安装以后，启动 Qemu 的截图。

1. Everything after '**Booting from Hard Disk**...' was printed by our skeletal JOS kernel.

## The PC's Physical Address Space

## The ROM BIOS

输入 `make qemu-nox-gdb`，启动 QEMU 作为 remote debugging target; 用 GDB 开始调试，输入 `make gdb`，得到下图所示内容：

![first_instruction_for_bios](assets/first_instruction_for_bios.png)

当 CPU 加电以后，它会从 ROM 中读取 Bios 启动固件，进入实模式并且设置 CS 寄存器到 0xf000，IP 到 0xfff0，然后开始执行指令。从上图中画线部分可以得出：

- The IBM PC starts executing at physical address 0x000ffff0, which is at the very top of the 64KB area reserved for the ROM BIOS
- The PC starts executing with CS = 0xf000 and IP = 0xfff0
- The first instruction to be executed is a jmp instruction, which jumps to the segmented address CS = 0xf000 and IP = 0xe05b

Why does QEMU start like this? This is how Intel designed the 8088 processor, which IBM used in their original PC. Because the BIOS in a PC is "hard-wired" to the physical address range 0x000f0000-0x000fffff, this design **ensures that the BIOS always gets control of the machine first** after power-up or any system restart - which is crucial because on power-up there is no other software anywhere in the machine's RAM that the processor could execute.

实模式寻址公式：**physical address = 16 * segment + offset**

通过 GDB 的 si (Step Instruction) 命令来单步调试 BIOS，你会发现 BIOS 做了一些基本的设置，比如：它会设置 interrupt descriptor table，初始化各种设备（如：VGA display）。After initializing the PCI bus and all the important devices the BIOS knows about, it searches for a bootable device such as a floppy, hard drive, or CD-ROM. Eventually, **when it finds a bootable disk, the BIOS reads the boot loader from the disk and transfers control to it**.

## The Boot Loader

Floppy and hard disks for PCs are divided into 512 byte regions called **sectors**. A sector is the disk's **minimum transfer granularity**: each read or write operation must be one or more sectors in size and aligned on a sector boundary. If the disk is bootable, **the first sector is called the boot sector**, since this is where the boot loader code resides. When the BIOS finds a bootable floppy or hard disk, **it loads the 512-byte boot sector into memory at physical addresses 0x7c00 through 0x7dff**, and then uses a jmp instruction to set the CS:IP to 0000:7c00, passing control to the boot loader.

The boot loader from JOS that consists of one assembly language source file, `boot/boot.S`, and one C source file, `boot/main.c`, and it perform two main functions:

1. First, the boot loader switches the processor from real mode to 32-bit protected mode, because it is only in this mode that software can access all the memory above 1MB in the processor's physical address space. Offsets only have 16 bits in real mode whereas it has 32 bits in protected mode, so it can access more memory address in protected mode.
2. Second, the boot loader reads the kernel from the hard disk.

I would mention two important files(`boot.asm` for the boot loader and `kernel.asm` for the JOS kernel) that **makes debugging easier**. Each of  the files is a disassembly and they make us easier to see exactly where in physical memory all of the code resides, and makes it easier to track what's happening while stepping through the boot-loader/JOS-kernel in GDB.

By tracking `boot.asm`, I can answer the following questions:

- At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?

> The answer for the question in the picture below:

![switch mode](assets/1.png)

- What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed, and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?

> 7d61:	ff 15 18 00 01 00    call   *0x10018
> movw   $0x1234,0x472

- Where is the first instruction of the kernel?

> The command `objdump -f obj/kern/kernel` can find out start address of the kernel. The other method is dumping word at `0x10018` with x/x command of GDB. Why the address is `0x10018`? Since the last instruction of the boot loader executed is `call *0x10018`, the first instruction of the kernel should be at this address.

- How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in order to fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this information?

> According to ELF header. The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) has a short description for **Executable and Linkable Format**

# Loading the Kernel

To make sense out of `boot/main.c` you'll need to know what an ELF binary is. ELF is quite complex, but you only need to know in 6.828 is that it includes **a header with loading information**, followed by **several program sections**, each of which is a contiguous chunk of code or data intended to be **loaded into memory at a specified address**. The boot loader does not modify the code or data; it loads it into memory and starts executing it. The structure of the ELF is shown in the picture below:

![structure of an ELF file](assets/ELF_file.png)

So, how can I get an ELF file from C source files? You need a series of tools, such as a preprocessor, compiler, assembler, and linker. The image below describes the whole process that a C program transforms an ELF file with some tools.

![Compile, link and execute stages for running program](assets/ccompilerlinker001.png)

We are more interested several ones of program sections of an ELF file, they are:

- `.text`: This section contains the executable instruction codes and is shared among every process running the same binary.
- `.rdata`: Also known as .rodata (read-only data) section. This contains constants and string literals.
- `.data`: Contains the initialized global and static variables and their values.
- `.reloc`: Stores the information required for relocating the image while loading.
- `.bss`: It holds un-initialized global and static variables. Since the BSS only holds variables that don't have any values yet, it doesn't actually need to store the image of these variables. The size that BSS will require at runtime is recorded in the object file, but the BSS (unlike the data section) doesn't take up any actual space in the object file.

The linker actually enables separate compilation. As shown in figure below, an executable can be made up of a number of source files which can be compiled and assembled into their object files respectively, and then link all of these object files and some libraries by linker.

![The object files linking process](assets/ccompilerlinker003.png)

With all of the knowledge above, Let's proceed about Lab 1. Like all of the other C programs, our JOS kernel also can be compiled to an ELF file. We can examine it by typing:

    objdump -h obj/kern/kernel

Take particular note of the "VMA" (Virtual Memory Address) and the "LMA" (Load Memory Address) of the .text section. The load memory address of a section is the memory address at which that section should be loaded into memory. The virtual memory address of a section is the memory address from which the section expects to execute. As shown in the figure below, load memory address is real physical addresses at which sections should be loaded into memory, whereas virtual memory address is virtual addresses which are used when instructions are executed, such as an address in EIP register is a virtual address. The processor's memory management hardware will map virtual address to physical address.

![Physical and virtual address: Address translation](assets/ccompilerlinker007.png)

The program header table tells the system how to create a process image. The boot loader uses it to decide how to load the sections. The program headers specify which parts of the ELF object to load into memory and the destination address each should occupy. You can inspect the program headers by typing:

    objdump -x obj/kern/kernel

The areas of the ELF object that need to be loaded into memory are those that are marked as "LOAD". So far, we have learned many things about ELF file, then let's play an example for understanding it better. As I mentioned above, The BIOS loads the boot sector into memory starting at address 0x7c00.By typing: 

    objdump -h obj/boot/boot.out

and not only you will see the load address of the .text section which is 0x7c00, but the virtual address is also this address. However, you can't expect that always be the case. For example, the kernel we will introduce later that its "VMA" and "LMA" is not the same.
